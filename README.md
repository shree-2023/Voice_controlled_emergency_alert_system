IOT project
Women in our country are unsafe everywhere. Public place safety is the need of the hour because the cases of harassment are increasing day by day. There are many reasons why women chose to keep silent when they come across any sort of harassment. The main motto behind initiating this application is to empower women and encourage them to claim their rights when injustice takes place. This application will help them express their views and make it go viral to ensure create a safe environment for others. Through this app women themselves will become self-sufficient to help each other when it comes to ensuring their safety at public place. Though this is a baby step but can turn out to be a big revolutionary step over a period of time the corresponding results were logged. The successful streaming of images of a live event on a web page was done within an intranet.
